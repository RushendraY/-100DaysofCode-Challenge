### Day 3: August 14, 2018 
##### Tuesday

**What did I learn today?** Learned about if statements & comparisions, dictionaries, while and for loops, exponent function

**Thoughts:** There is a self doubt inside whether i am doing right or wrong. But deep inside, i feel not to stop, not to quit what i started. I usually quit. This is what i did till now. 97 days more. If i don't invest in myself, who will? I don't know how skilled i will become after this challenge - #100DaysofCode. But i strongly believe I will have something to cherish looking back. :-)

### Day 4: August 15, 2018 
##### Wednesday

**Thoughts:** I was feeling sleepy. Not able to focus well. I am able to realise the importance of sleep and how it had impacted my concentration and productivity all these years. If I want to become strong, focused, I should invest my time in best quality sleep. Coming to the challenge, inside there is a feeling i am losing 2 hours of time. But I want to learn to practice balancing things, especially when it comes to learning new things. I will focus on the exam and on the challenge too.

### Day 29: September 9, 2018 
##### Sunday

**What did I learn today?** Got certificate - Javascript @sololearn

**Thoughts:** did 3 hour 10 min today to compensate what i lost. feeling happy. But i shouldn't procrastinate yar. It really sucks compensating the lost time. I have few more hours to compensate. I will do them in upcoming days. OMG. It feels horrible completing pending work. I should learn from this mistake. Only a fool won't learn from his mistakes. I am not a fool. And I should do the same in my exam prep. If you become lazy and procrastinate the work you should do to make your life better, that work will not only eat the procrastinated time but also the future time which you should compensate to complete it. Single work. Double time. Making life stressful. Think darling. Don't repeat the same mistakes yar. Just do it.
