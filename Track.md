# 100 Days Of Code - Track

### Day 1: August 12, 2018 
##### Sunday

**What did I learn today?** Learned about print, variables, data types, strings, numbers. Also made a basic calculator and mad libs game.

**Thoughts:** I feel excited. I just want to travel this journey till end. Because, I have never completed anything which i started till now. This should be my first win.

### Day 2: August 13, 2018 
##### Monday

 **What did I learn today?** Learned about lists, list functions, Tuples, functions, return statement and if statements.
 
 **Thoughts:** I felt this 2018 should add something to my life - a new skill (coding). I don't want to waste this year. So I want to pursue this challenge till end at any cost. Just one hour. Let's see what change it will bring.

### Day 3: August 14, 2018 
##### Tuesday

**What did I learn today?** Learned about if statements & comparisions, dictionaries, while and for loops, exponent function

**Thoughts:** There is a self doubt inside whether i am doing right or wrong. But deep inside, i feel not to stop, not to quit what i started. I usually quit. This is what i did till now. 97 days more. If i don't invest in myself, who will? I don't know how skilled i will become after this challenge - #100DaysofCode. But i strongly believe I will have something to cherish looking back. :-)

### Day 4: August 15, 2018 
##### Wednesday

**What did I learn today?** Learned about 2D lists, Nested loops, Try/Except use, Reading and Writing files

**Thoughts:** I was feeling sleepy. Not able to focus well. I am able to realise the importance of sleep and how it had impacted my concentration and productivity all these years. If I want to become strong, focused, I should invest my time in best quality sleep. Coming to the challenge, inside there is a feeling i am losing 2 hours of time. But I want to learn to practice balancing things, especially when it comes to learning new things. I will focus on the exam and on the challenge too.
